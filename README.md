# PandaPal

Mobile app with tab-based navigation for iOS (and Android). Built with Expo and Expo Router.

## Tabs

- **Quests** – default tab
- **Avatar**
- **Learn**
- **Caregiver**
- **More**

Screens are placeholders; add your content as you build the app.

## Run on iOS

```bash
npm install
npm run ios
```

This starts the dev server and opens the app in the iOS simulator. Use **Expo Go** on a device, or run a development build with `npx expo run:ios` after `npx expo prebuild` if you need a custom native build.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Xcode and iOS Simulator (Mac)
